## About Me

I received my B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Interactive Entertainment from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo in March 2021. 
I have a passion for games and am looking for a position where I can learn from others who share my passions and can help 
me expand my skill set. I am excited to work on challenging projects which provide the opportunity to produce quality games while 
growing as a developer. 

When making a game, I strive to build a cohesive theme that enhances the player's experience. 
I like developing situations which encourage strategic thinking and enjoy the process of 
devising puzzles and challenges. I also have experience making action and shooter games 
using Unity and Unreal 4 and developing game graphics directly with OpenGL's API.

I like playing video games (obviously). I enjoy engaging in the depth of strategies and puzzles,  
unwinding in the flow of action, and savoring a good storyline. In my spare time I swim, hike, 
and play with my dog Chip.

## Projects

The projects highlighted in this portfolio were created during my time at Cal Poly and help showcase my skills and the growth 
of my game designs over the course of my education. They are listed in reverse chronological order.
