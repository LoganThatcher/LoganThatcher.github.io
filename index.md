## About Me

I received my B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Interactive Entertainment from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo in March 2021.
I have a passion for games and am looking for a position where I can learn from others who share my passions and can help
 me expand my skill set. I am excited to work on challenging projects which provide the opportunity to produce quality games while 
 growing as a developer. 

 The projects highlighted in this portfolio were created during my time at Cal Poly and help showcase my skills and the growth
  of my game designs over the course of my education. They are listed in reverse chronological order.


When making a game, I enjoy building a cohesive theme that enhances the player's experience. 
I like making strategic games and enjoy thinking through puzzles and challenges. 
I also have experience making action and shooter games using game engines like Unity and Unreal 4
and the graphics system OpenGL.
