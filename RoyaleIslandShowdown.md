# Project Summary

Royale Island Showdown is an online multiplayer shooter. It contains battle royale elements where 4 players 
will dive down on the island map, 
collect resources, and try to be the last player standing.  Each player has an AI teammate that 
works with them to win.

### Development

This game is an independent project built in Unreal Engine 4. I used the client server architecture to 
create a stable and secure multiplayer environment. I designed an AI companion that strived to be an 
effective and cooperative teammate. The AI had a perception system which closely mirrored the 
information that was available to the player. It used this information in a modified K-nearest neighbors
algorithm to predict how the player would react to situations. The AI added this information to a 
Behavior Tree to make decisions and execute actions.

Royale Island Showdown was made using a combination of C++ and Unreal Blueprints.

The game is available on Steam. [Link to the steam store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1528570/Royale_Island_Showdown/)

In this fight, at the beginning the red AI recognizes that the red player is going after the Blue team and runs to lead the way. 
The blue AI runs for cover behind the tree but once his blue player backs off, he turns to join him.


## Additional Technical Effects 

![Image of Border Wall](https://loganthatcher.com/images/RIS/images/BorderWall.png)

There is a border wall that periodically shrinks to restrict play space to maintain pacing and encourages players to interact.

![Image of Low Health](https://loganthatcher.com/images/RIS/images/LowHealth.png)

Low health is indicated to the player by light blurring as well as red tinting and vignette. 
These effects become more pronounced as health drops.

![Image of Underwater](https://loganthatcher.com/images/RIS/images/Underwater.png)

When players are underwater, they slowly lose health. While underwater there is a blue tinting and strong vignette.
